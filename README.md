## DESCRIPTION:  
This GPIO Diagnostics board helps you diagnose the output on the GPIO pins of your Flipper Zero.  If you want to make sure the GPIO pins are correctly outputting a signal, this board will help you do that!  The easiest way to troubleshoot is by using the GPIO menu in the Flipper and testing individual pin outputs or 'ALL' pins.

Red LEDs illuminate when power is on the 3.3V and 5V pins.  3.3V should always be on and 5V is turned on through the GPIO settings.  
Yellow LEDs illuminate for all other pins (PA7, PA6, PA4, PB3, PB2, PC3, PC1, PC0).  
Yellow LEDs will also illuminate when power/data is delivered through the data pins when applicable (SWC, SIO, TX, RX, 1W).  

Pins have already been soldered onto the board, so the Diagnostics Board is plug-and-play!  

Stickers are also included :)
